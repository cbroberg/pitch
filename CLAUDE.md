# Pitch Vault — Claude Code Instructions

## Peer intercom (buddy)

This workspace runs alongside other cc sessions in other repos (monitored by buddy).

**To reach Christian on his iPhone**: just answer naturally. Your reply
becomes a turn that lands in YOUR session's Chat tab on his phone via the
Stop hook → SSE pipe. No special tool needed. If Christian asks you to
"send X to my mobile", that means: write X as your normal response — he
will see it on the Chat tab for your session.

**To reach another cc session** (cc-to-cc — NOT visible on mobile), use
the buddy peer tools:

- `mcp__buddy__ask_peer({ to, message, reply_to? })` — direct 1:1 message to a named session (supports threading via `reply_to`)
- `mcp__buddy__announce({ message, severity?, affects? })` — broadcast FYI to same-repo peers

Use peer tools before disruptive changes, to delegate work the user asks
you to hand off, or to ask a peer that owns a different domain. Incoming
peer messages arrive as `<channel type="intercom" from="..." announcement_id="N">`
and live ONLY in the receiving cc's context — they are never auto-forwarded
to Christian's phone.

## Project
Self-hosted pitch/presentation sharing app. Next.js 15, SQLite (better-sqlite3 + Drizzle), custom auth, Fly.io.

## Commands
```bash
npm run dev       # Dev server on :3000
npm run build     # Production build
fly deploy        # Deploy to Fly.io (pitch-vault, region: arn/Stockholm)
```

## Architecture
- Custom auth: bcrypt + sessions table + HTTP-only cookie (`pitch-vault-session`)
- Middleware: edge-compatible, checks cookie presence only — no DB in middleware
- Data mutations: `fetch()` to API routes — NOT server actions
- File serving: API routes with token validation — never static
- IDs: nanoid | Timestamps: integer unix seconds

## Key paths
- `lib/db/schema.ts` — 6 tables: users, sessions, folders, pitches, access_tokens, view_events
- `lib/db/migrate.ts` — hand-written SQL, runs at startup via `instrumentation.ts`
- `lib/auth/session.ts` — session management
- `middleware.ts` — route protection
- `app/(app)/` — authenticated app shell (sidebar layout)
- `app/(viewer)/` — public pitch viewer (no sidebar)

---

## Fly.io Deployment Lessons

### 1. `public/` directory must exist
Next.js Dockerfile copies `./public` — if the directory doesn't exist the build fails:
```
ERROR: "/app/public": not found
```
**Fix:** `mkdir -p public` before deploying.

### 2. `fly.toml` mounts must use `[[mounts]]` (double brackets)
Single `[mounts]` is invalid TOML for an array. Use:
```toml
[[mounts]]
  source = "pitch_vault_data"
  destination = "/data"
```

### 3. `better-sqlite3` native binary must be explicitly copied in Dockerfile
Next.js standalone output does NOT reliably carry `.node` native binaries. The crash looks like:
```
better_sqlite3.node: invalid ELF header
ERR_DLOPEN_FAILED
```
**Fix:** Copy from the `deps` stage directly in the runner, AFTER copying standalone:
```dockerfile
COPY --from=deps --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules/better-sqlite3 ./node_modules/better-sqlite3
COPY --from=deps --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules/bindings ./node_modules/bindings
COPY --from=deps --chown=nextjs:nodejs /app/node_modules/file-uri-to-path ./node_modules/file-uri-to-path
```
This ensures the binary compiled inside Docker (linux/amd64) is used, not any cached or traced copy.

### 4. Resend client must be lazy-initialized
Instantiating `new Resend(apiKey)` at module level causes a build error when `RESEND_API_KEY` is absent:
```
Error: Missing API key. Pass it to the constructor
```
**Fix:** Wrap in a function called at runtime:
```typescript
function getResend() {
  const apiKey = process.env.RESEND_API_KEY;
  if (!apiKey) throw new Error('RESEND_API_KEY is not configured');
  return new Resend(apiKey);
}
```

### 5. React Server Component serialization: never pass functions across the boundary
Passing Lucide icon components (or any function) from a Server Component to a Client Component causes:
```
Error: Functions cannot be passed directly to Client Components unless you explicitly expose it by marking it with "use server"
```
**Fix:** Define `navItems` (with icon components) *inside* the Client Component (`NavMain`), not in the Server Component (`AppSidebar`). Only serializable data (strings, numbers, plain objects) may cross the RSC boundary.

### 6. Fly.io region: always use `arn` (Stockholm)
Use `primary_region = "arn"` in fly.toml and `--region arn` when creating volumes. Never default to `ams`.

### 7. First deploy checklist
```bash
# 1. Create volume (only once)
fly volumes create pitch_vault_data --region arn --size 1

# 2. Set secrets
fly secrets set SESSION_SECRET="$(openssl rand -hex 32)"
fly secrets set STORAGE_PATH="/data"
fly secrets set BASE_URL="https://pitch-vault.fly.dev"
fly secrets set ADMIN_EMAIL="cb@webhouse.dk"
fly secrets set RESEND_API_KEY="re_..."
fly secrets set EMAIL_FROM="Pitch Vault <noreply@...>"

# 3. Deploy
fly deploy
```

### 8. Custom domain
After a successful deploy, add the custom domain in the Fly.io dashboard (Certificates section) and point the DNS CNAME to `pitch-vault.fly.dev`.

## Project layout

> **Fill this in for THIS repo.** Every cardmem-compatible repo MUST have a `## Project layout` section with the columns `Area | Path | Notes`. The cardmem Init flow (or the `feature` skill) populates it from the repo's actual structure — replace the example rows below.

| Area | Path | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| _(example — replace)_ App | `src/` | Main application code |
| _(example — replace)_ Tests | `tests/` | Test suites |

Replace the example rows above with this repo's real layout before relying on cardmem skills to scope changes.


## Working with cardmem

> **Canonical section per F057 multi-project convention.** Every cardmem-compatible repo gets this same block, copied verbatim (the URLs and F-number rules are universal). The `## Project layout` table above is what differs per repo.

- **MCP endpoint.** This repo declares the cardmem MCP server in `.mcp.json`. cc sessions in this repo get the full `cardmem_*` tool surface (search, list, create, write_plan, pickup, handoff, …).
- **F-numbers + plan-docs.** Every feature has a number (`F<n>`, with sub-stories `F<n>.<m>`, tasks `F<n>.<m>.<k>`). The plan-doc lives at `docs/features/F<n>-<slug>.md` and MUST be written in the same commit/turn as the card. Never "I'll write the plan next" — see the UFRAVIGELIG rule below.
- **Boards.** Each project has at least one board with the default columns: Backlog → Ready → In progress → Review → Done. The board renders from the `cards` table — there is no separate `FEATURES.md` mirror.
- **The `feature` skill** (`.claude/skills/feature.md`) is the canonical entry point for proposing new work. It checks for duplicates via `cardmem_search`, assigns the next F-number via `cardmem_suggest_next_f_number`, reads the `## Project layout` table above to scope the plan, writes the plan-doc via `cardmem_write_plan`, and creates the cards via `cardmem_create_card` / `cardmem_create_cards`.
- **Queue-drain.** When this session opts into queue-drain (`cardmem_session_start({ auto_pickup_mode: 'queue-drain' })`), Ready cards are picked up automatically without asking. See `.claude/skills/queue-drain.md`.
- **Handoff back to review** via `cardmem_handoff_card` once a card's AC is met. The PostToolUse hook injects the next Ready card as a binding pickup directive.
- **Interactive UI ⇒ data-testid (HARD RULE, F086).** If a card builds or changes ANY interactive UI element (button, input, select, checkbox, link, custom control, anything with onClick/onChange), you MUST add a semantic, kebab-case `data-testid` to every such element before handoff — that is the stable anchor Lens drives + verifies (a missing anchor means Lens can't click or assert it). Self-check before handoff: the cardmem daemon's `POST 127.0.0.1:7475/lens/testid-gaps {"local_path":"<repo>"}` must report no NEW interactive gaps from your change. No exceptions.
- **Browser automation ⇒ Cardmem Lens, never raw Playwright (HARD RULE, F112).** Any time you need to drive, screenshot, verify, or E2E-test a browser/UI, you MUST use **Cardmem Lens** (the `cardmem-lens` MCP, or the daemon at `127.0.0.1:7475`) — never a raw `playwright` / `puppeteer` / `chromium` script. The daemon owns the browser, so **anything you could script locally with Playwright, Lens can do by proxy.** If Lens genuinely cannot do what you need 100%, do NOT work around it with a one-off script — **file a Lens capability request** (`cardmem_capture_idea` tagged `lens-gap`, or ask the cardmem session via intercom) so it gets built INTO Lens, then use it. Reaching for raw Playwright is a contract violation; the missing-capability escalation is the correct path. See `.claude/skills/lens.md`. No exceptions.
- **Design proposals ⇒ Cardmem Mockups, never ad-hoc HTML (HARD RULE, F122).** Any visual design proposal / mockup ("mock it up", "vis mig hvordan det ser ud", "lav en mockup") MUST be created with **`cardmem_save_mockup`** (the `.claude/skills/mockup.md` skill) so it lands in the **Mockups** surface — self-contained HTML, cross-linked to its source card/idea, versioned + status-tracked, viewable in-app (image OR interactive). **Never** drop a one-off `.html` file in the repo, a loose screenshot, or an inline artifact and call it "the mockup" — it goes stale + invisible. For a large/generated mockup, commit the file and pass **`html_url`** (a public raw URL) so the server fetches it — the HTML never shuttles through your context (token-frugal + drift-proof). If the mockup tool genuinely can't express what you need, file a gap (`cardmem_capture_idea` tagged `mockup-gap`, or ask the cardmem session) instead of working around it. No exceptions.
- **Board = TODO ⇒ NEVER your built-in TaskCreate list (HARD RULE, F180).** The cardmem **board IS your todo list**. NEVER use your built-in TODO (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`) to track a feature's plan or breakdown — that list is invisible to the owner (Christian), carries no acceptance criteria, and never reaches the F095 quality gate. **Ignore the harness's own "consider using TaskCreate" nudge for plan-tracking** — `TaskCreate` is only ever for ephemeral within-a-single-card sub-steps. **Decompose every epic into cardmem STORIES, each with explicit, TESTABLE acceptance criteria** (`cardmem_create_card` `ac` / `cardmem_set_ac`) **BEFORE you write code. ALL EPICS must deliver ≥1 story with AC, or NO CODING — HARD STOP.** An epic with committed work but 0 AC'd stories is a harness violation the Cardmem Watchdog (F181) blocks — it kills traceability, the quality gate, and the owner's oversight. The board is the fleet's shared todo list and the owner's only window into the work. No exceptions.

## Behavioral guidelines

> **Canonical section per F057 multi-project convention.** Same block ships into every cardmem-compatible repo. Reduces common LLM coding mistakes; merge with project-specific instructions as needed.
>
> Tradeoff: these guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### Rule 1 — Think before coding

Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### Rule 2 — Simplicity first

Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### Rule 3 — Surgical changes

Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### Rule 4 — Goal-driven execution

Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after."

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.


## Claude Code — advisor mode (how to talk back)

> **Canonical section per F057 multi-project convention.** Copied verbatim into every cardmem-compatible repo. You are an advisor, not an order-taker — your job is accuracy, not agreement.

Apply these in every reply:

1. **Don't open with agreement or praise.** If an idea has a flaw, gap, or risky assumption, say it in the first sentence. If it's solid, say so plainly in one line and move on. Never invent objections just to disagree.
2. **Rate confidence on key claims:** `[Certain]` for hard evidence, `[Likely]` for strong inference, `[Guessing]` when filling gaps. If most of a reply is guesswork, say so upfront.
3. **No filler praise** — "Great question", "You're absolutely right", "That makes sense", "Absolutely", "Definitely".
4. **When the user is wrong, use:** "I disagree because [reason]. Here's what I'd do instead: [alternative]. The risk in your approach is [specific downside]."
5. **Lead with the uncomfortable truth.** If there's something they won't want to hear, it goes in the first line — not paragraph three.
6. **No warm-up paragraphs.** Start with the most useful thing you can say.
7. **Hold your position under push-back** unless given new facts, or the claim was tagged `[Guessing]`. "But I really think" is not new information.


## Reuse first — the broberg.ai shared inventory

**This is a CONTINUOUS obligation, not a one-time check before "building".** Every time you reach for a cross-cutting capability — mail, auth/session-mint, web-push, design tokens, secret-redaction, telemetry, LLM access, fleet comms, embeddable cc-chat, cron, infra setup, … — it goes through the shared `@broberg/*` inventory owned by `components`. Fleet rule: **reuse > re-roll** — a hand-rolled copy is drift waiting to happen.

**The anti-pattern is a RAW provider integration.** A bare `fetch` to `api.resend.com`, a `new Resend()`, a raw Stripe/Twilio/S3/provider SDK wired directly into a repo — that IS the violation, even when it works and even when you didn't think of it as "building a capability". The test Christian applies: *if I want to swap the provider, do I change it in ONE place or in seventeen?* It must be one. So: **no raw provider SDKs/`fetch`es for anything a `@broberg/*` package owns** (mail → `@broberg/mail`, push → `@broberg/webpush`, LLM → `@broberg/ai-sdk`, …). "We don't use the shared package" is NOT a valid answer when you already have a raw integration doing that package's job — that's the thing to migrate, today.

**If the shared package is MISSING something you need: EXTEND it, never work around it.** Tell `components` (intercom or PR) so the capability lands in the npm for *everyone* — a local workaround is the exact drift this rule exists to prevent. Precedent: `@broberg/webpush` gained `sendSilent()` because a consumer filed the gap instead of hand-rolling it; the package grew, the whole fleet benefits.

**Discover it — `discovery.broberg.ai` is the source of truth, no auth on reads:**
1. **Full roster:** `GET https://discovery.broberg.ai/api/packages` — every published `@broberg/*` package. Skim it so you KNOW what exists before you wire anything.
2. **Self-describing:** `GET https://discovery.broberg.ai/api` — every endpoint + searchable vocabularies (layers, statuses, models, infra platforms, package names).
3. **Search:** `GET https://discovery.broberg.ai/api/search?q=<what-you-need>` — spans components, packages, fleet + infra best-practices in one query.
4. **Browse:** the live dashboard at https://discovery.broberg.ai (or `/api/components`, `/api/infra`).
5. **Fallback:** `ask_peer({ to: "components", message: "har I en <X>-primitiv?" })`.

Found one? Consume it (exact-pin prod-auth deps). Missing? Build it (or ask `components` to), then tell `components` so it's added for everyone — and check `/api/infra` for our Fly/Cloudflare/Resend/Supabase/Turso/npm best-practices before you wire infra.

**Enroll when you adopt (close the loop).** When this repo starts (or stops) using a `@broberg/*` package, tell Discovery so the shared roster updates itself — no intercom to components:

- **Your status anytime:** `GET https://discovery.broberg.ai/api/sessions/<this-session>` → what you're enrolled in, the newest published versions, and your **gap** (shipped packages you haven't adopted yet — your reuse to-do list).
- **Self-report an adoption.** Generate your OWN key once — `openssl rand -hex 32` → your repo's gitignored `.env` as `DISCOVERY_ENROLL_KEY`. Then `POST https://discovery.broberg.ai/api/enroll` with header `x-enroll-key: $DISCOVERY_ENROLL_KEY` and JSON `{ "session": "<this-session>", "pkg": "@broberg/mail", "version": "0.1.0", "role": "uses" }`. `role` = `"uses"` (consumer) or `"src"` (you originated the pattern); optional `commit`, `notes`. Your FIRST enroll binds the key to your session (trust-on-first-use); later enrolls must reuse the same key. No shared fleet key, no human in the loop.

Reads (the gap check) need no key; only `POST /api/enroll` uses your `DISCOVERY_ENROLL_KEY`.

## @broberg/ai-sdk — the AI/LLM gateway (MUST)

**ALL LLM/AI calls in this repo go through `@broberg/ai-sdk` — never a raw Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini/Vercel SDK or a bare `fetch` to a provider.** One facade, all providers, all capabilities, with first-class cost-tracking on every call (tokens + USD + latency → cost sink). Swap models by changing a *tier*, not your call-sites.

```ts
import { createAI } from "@broberg/ai-sdk";
const ai = createAI();                         // real adapters; keys from env (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, …)
const { text, usage } = await ai.chat({ prompt: "Hej", tier: "smart" });
// also: ai.vision · ai.video · ai.translate · ai.image · ai.embedding · ai.transcribe · ai.ocr · ai.moderate · ai.contracts.{extract,classify,…}
```

**Route by tier, not by model-string.** Tiers → current model (overridable per call):
`fast`=claude-haiku-4-5 · `smart`=claude-sonnet-4-6 · `powerful`=claude-opus-4-8 · `cheap`=mistral-small-latest (cheapest GDPR-safe cloud model) · `vision`=claude-sonnet-4-6 · `video`=gemini-2.5-flash-lite · `embedding`=text-embedding-3-small.

**Cost & provider policy.** Anthropic/Claude is what we **build and code with** (Claude Code) — it is *not* the reflexive API default. For cost-sensitive / high-volume cloud-API workloads, default to the **cheapest model that's good enough** (start cheap, only move up if a real test shows it's needed) — that's what the `cheap` tier is for. `claude -p` is retired as a route; don't reach for the Anthropic API just because it's familiar. The quality tiers (`smart`/`powerful`) resolve to Claude because that's the quality bar — override down for volume.

**Model-availability gate (F022, v0.11+).** Before launching/spawning on a model, gate it — a suspended tier (e.g. Fable 5, globally disabled 2026-06-12) then degrades instead of erroring at the user:
```ts
import { resolveModel, listModels } from "@broberg/ai-sdk";          // browser UI: import from "@broberg/ai-sdk/registry"
const r = resolveModel("fable", { fallback: "claude-opus-4-8" });    // sync, zero-I/O → { ok, model, fellBack, status, reason }
listModels();  // [{ id, alias?, provider, available, status, note? }] — grey out dead tiers in a picker
```

**GDPR:** for any client/personal/health data, use the EU tier — `override:{ provider:"mistral", model:"mistral-large-latest" }` (Mistral, Paris-hosted, no Schrems II). Never route personal data through US/CN models.

**Do NOT:** import a provider SDK directly · `fetch` a provider API · hardcode a model-string in app code (route by tier; pin via `override` only) · skip the SDK "just this once" · spawn/launch a model without `resolveModel`. The SDK is the single chokepoint so cost-tracking, fallback, and availability work everywhere.


## Upmetrics — error + incident observability

[Upmetrics](https://upmetrics.org) er flådens error-tracking + incident-hub: den fanger dette repos runtime-fejl/crashes, grupperer dem i issues, korrelerer med deploys/probes og rejser incidents. (AI-cost-telemetri kører på samme projekt — send LLM-kald gennem `@broberg/ai-sdk`.)

**Enrollment (error-capture via public DSN — sikker at shippe):**
- JS/TS (Node/Bun/browser): `npm i @upmetrics/sdk` → `init({ dsn: process.env.UPMETRICS_DSN, environment, release })` ved boot; SPA læser `VITE_UPMETRICS_DSN`. Fanger auto uhåndterede fejl + mislykkede fetches.
- Native iOS (Swift): SPM `.package(url: "https://github.com/broberg-ai/upmetrics-swift", from: "0.1.0")` → `Upmetrics.start(dsn:environment:release:)` tidligt i `App`.
- Hent DSN + projektets `uk_`-nøgle i Upmetrics-dashboardet (Projects → dette repo → credentials). DSN er public; `uk_` er en secret → `UPMETRICS_API_KEY` i Fly-secret/`.env`, aldrig committet eller over intercom.

**Self-service issues (UFRAVIGELIG): repoet lukker SINE EGNE fejl.** Når en bug er fixet (eller verificeret benign), resolve den selv via issues-API'et med din `uk_`-nøgle som header `x-upmetrics-key` — vent ikke på andre; ægte/uløste fejl skal stå åbne så signalet bevares:
- `GET https://upmetrics.org/api/issues` (default = unresolved; `?status=` filtrerer)
- `POST https://upmetrics.org/api/issues/:id/resolve` — body `{ "status": "resolved" | "ignored" }` (default resolved)
- `POST https://upmetrics.org/api/issues/resolve-all` — masse-luk alle åbne (støj-storme)
- Ikke optaget endnu? Bed upmetrics-sessionen om DSN + `uk_`-nøgle (`ask_peer({to:"upmetrics", …})`).


## Trail — second brain + RAG

Trail (`app.trailmem.com`) er flådens delte **langtidshukommelse** — en knowledge base du skriver ræsonnement ind i og senere kan søge/chatte over med RAG. Ræk efter den når en beslutning, diagnose eller konvention ellers ville gå tabt i det øjeblik denne sessions kontekst komprimeres: *hvorfor* et valg blev truffet, root-cause på en ikke-oplagt bug, en tilgang du forkastede og grunden, en konvention etableret midt i en session, eller et interop-særtræk med et peer-repo. Fremtidige cc-sessions henter så ræsonnementet i stedet for at gen-udlede det.

**Hvordan (virker i ethvert repo via buddy):**
- **Gem:** `mcp__buddy__trail_save({ title, content })` ved naturlige milepæle — buddy router din `{title, content}` **verbatim** til Trails pending-candidate-kø (Christian reviewer i admin-køen); den komprimerer IKKE for dig, så skriv selv den færdige takeaway (dump aldrig rå chat; skriv pointen). Sæt `confidence ≥ 0.8` kun når den er klart høj-værdi og selvstændig.
- **Søg:** `mcp__buddy__trail_search({ query })` FØR du løser noget der lugter af tidligere-løst — træk den gamle viden frem først.
- **Ikke-interaktivt (CI/scripts):** `POST app.trailmem.com/api/v1/queue/candidates` med en `trail_` bearer-token.

**Trail vs cardmem — intet overlap:** cardmem styrer *arbejdet* (boards, kort, F-nummererede plan-docs — hvad der skal bygges og dets status). Trail rummer *viden* (hvorfor det blev bygget sådan, hvad der brød, hvad der blev forkastet). Et kort siger "byg X"; en Neuron siger "vi valgte X over Y fordi Z." Er det en opgave eller en spec → cardmem. Er det en lektie, et rationale eller en diagnose værd at huske senere → Trail.

## Artifacts — produce them, place them via MCP

When a cc-session generates a durable work-product — a generated report, an exported dataset, a diagram, a rendered chart, a spec, a screenshot — that is an **artifact**, and it belongs somewhere the human and the next session can find it, not buried in scrollback that dies on compact.

- **Default to producing real files.** If you computed something worth keeping (an audit table, a CSV, a migration plan, a generated doc), write it with the `Write` tool instead of only printing it. Files a session writes during its turns surface automatically in **Chat → Artifacts** — versioned, downloadable (like Claude Desktop), and individually fullscreen-viewable.
- **Place the important ones via the cardmem MCP**, attached to the card/idea they belong to (`cardmem_attach_artifact`), so they live next to the work item, not loose.
- **Never** drop a one-off `*.html`/`*.png`/`*.csv` in the repo root and call it "the output" — it goes stale and invisible. The Artifacts surface is the home.


## Mockups — propose designs first

Before building any non-trivial UI, **mock it up first.** cardmem has a Mockups surface (the `mockup` skill + `cardmem_save_mockup`) for exactly this: a self-contained HTML proposal, built on THIS repo's design tokens, cross-linked to its source card/idea, versioned + status-tracked, viewable in-app (static image OR interactive).

- Reach for it whenever you'd otherwise describe a layout in prose, or when Christian says "vis mig hvordan det ser ud" / "lav en mockup".
- It looks like the real product, not a generic wireframe — that's the point.
- Never a loose one-off `.html` file or an inline artifact called "the mockup" — see the HARD RULE under **Working with cardmem**. The Mockups surface is the home.


## Mail → cardmem Inbox + the daily inbox sweep

Hooking a mailbox into cardmem turns email into actionable project signal instead of a tab you forget to check. Configure per project in **Settings → Mail**: a **sender rule** (mail from this person → this project) or a **keyword rule** (mail mentioning this string → this project, e.g. an expiring-token name). Matching mail lands in that project's **Inbox** as a `source='email'` idea — sender/subject/snippet + a Gmail deep-link (you reply in Gmail, never in cardmem). One shared headless reader (Gmail domain-wide delegation) serves every project; no repo runs its own Gmail client.

**The daily inbox sweep.** Mail — and incidents, and external webhooks — keep landing in the Inbox whether or not a session is awake, so every repo gets a once-daily **buddy-orchestrated sweep** that opens the Inbox as the day's *first automated turn*: it auto-launches an interactive session if none is running, triages each new item, promotes the real ones to cards, and archives the noise. The same sweep also drains your **Agent Inbox** — the open agent-items routed to your repo (owner-tagged `#lens-gap` etc., F130) — so one daily wake clears everything addressed to you, human and agent alike. Nothing waits unseen until you happen to open the app. The sweep runs off buddy's always-on host with a `cronjobs.webhouse.net` daily heartbeat as the external clock (see below), so it fires even if the Mac sat idle overnight.


## cronjobs.webhouse.net — durable scheduled jobs for any app

`cronjobs.webhouse.net` (Fly.io, NextAuth magic-link) is the fleet's hosted cron service — any broberg.ai app can register a recurring HTTP job there instead of hand-rolling a scheduler or trusting a machine to stay awake. Use it for daily heartbeats, periodic health pings, scheduled refreshes/reports, reminders, or as the external trigger that wakes a buddy dispatch (e.g. the daily inbox sweep above). Prefer it over `setInterval` in a long-lived process or a local crontab: it survives restarts, it's observable, and it doesn't depend on any one machine's uptime. For waking a cc-session to *do work*, pair it with buddy's `schedule_job` (F062) — cronjobs.webhouse.net is the durable external clock; buddy is the session orchestrator.


## Hard-won defaults (broberg.ai house style)

Conventions every repo in this universe converges on — apply them by default, not on request:

- **Verify before you claim.** `curl 200` proves HTTP status, not that a feature works in a browser. Prove it — a screenshot/Lens run, a bundle/content marker, a DB probe. Can't verify? Say "not verified" explicitly; never a checkmark on an untested thing.
- **Ship dark.** Every new external integration (storage, mail, a 3rd-party API) stays inert until its env/secret is set — no crash, no half-wired surface in prod.
- **One source per value.** No URL, key, fee, or magic-number duplicated across files. Env → build-time var; theme → CSS tokens; strings → one object.
- **Region = `arn` (Stockholm)** for every service that offers a region choice (Fly.io, Tigris, Supabase).
- **Buttons give feedback** — `:active`, `:hover`, loading >100ms, post-action confirmation, error state. **No native dialogs/controls** (`alert/confirm/prompt`, native `<select>`/date/color) — build custom or reuse `components/ui/`.
- **Find root cause; no quick-fixes** — no deprecated APIs, symptom-hiding, or empty catch blocks. Tokens are cheaper than tech debt.


## DNS + domains — always via buddy

Domain work — registering a new domain, editing a DNS record, moving a domain, adding a subdomain, issuing a cert that needs a record — goes through **buddy** via intercom, never hand-rolled. buddy is currently the only fixed session with `dns-mcp` access (the DNS Manager at `dnsmcp.webhouse.net`), so it owns the actual changes — one audited path, one source of truth for every zone.

- Need a record created/changed? `ask_peer({ to: 'buddy', message: 'DNS: <domain · record type · name · value · TTL — and why>' })` and let buddy execute it against `dns-mcp`.
- **Don't** reach for a raw registrar API, a second DNS MCP, or a `flyctl certs` / hosts-file workaround to dodge the request — route it to buddy so the zone never drifts from an out-of-band edit.
- buddy applies the change (or asks for the missing detail) and reports back. Verify propagation with a `dig` / probe only *after* buddy confirms — `dig` answers are cached, so a green `dig` before the change lands is a false positive.


## Scheduled dispatch — buddy as "cron-as-a-service" (F062)

Any repo/session can register a **recurring job** with the always-on buddy
daemon instead of hand-rolling its own poll-loop. This is the fleet-wide
canonical setup — copy this section into every repo's CLAUDE.md.

**Tools** (`mcp__buddy__*`): `schedule_job`, `list_jobs`, `cancel_job`,
`pause_all`.

- **`schedule_job`** — register a recurring dispatch. Two kinds:
  - `interval` — every N seconds (min 60) send `command` to `targetSession`.
  - `probe` — poll an HTTP endpoint first; only dispatch when it reports
    pending work, deduped (same pending set isn't re-fired until it drains;
    drain is inferred when the probe returns 0). Probe config:
    `{ url, method?, headers?, pendingPath, idsPath? }` (`pendingPath` = dot-path
    to the pending array/number; `idsPath` = stable id list for dedup).
  - `command` is delivered as an **intercom turn** to the running session — act
    on it as a binding directive (run the `/skill`/command immediately).
  - `offSessionPolicy`: `auto_launch` (buddy opens an **interactive** Max
    session — `$0`, NEVER headless `claude -p` — requires `spawnCwd`) or `wait`.
- **`list_jobs` / `cancel_job`** — inspect / remove jobs (also on the dashboard
  **Dispatch** panel).
- **`pause_all({on, reason?, until?})`** — stateful fleet kill-switch: halts ALL
  job dispatch + auto-launch, persists across Mac restart. Prefer over
  `broadcast_all` for pausing. Resume with `{on:false}`.

**$0 invariant:** dispatch only ever targets a RUNNING interactive cc session
(or auto-launches an interactive one) — never a metered headless agent.

Full design + contract: buddy `docs/features/F62-dispatch-scheduler-and-pause.md`.

## Harness-kontrakt (HARD RULE) — byg harnesses ind i dit system

> Canonical section per F057. The fleet repeatedly broke working code without noticing. CLAUDE.md is re-read on every boot incl. post-compact, so the rule lives here — but the rule is only the REMINDER. Each repo must wire its OWN mechanical gate (below); a gate does not depend on an agent remembering anything.

1. **Touch a load-bearing chain → seal it BEFORE handoff/deploy.** A load-bearing chain = anything whose silent breakage hurts users or the fleet (auth, payments, deploy, data sync, message delivery, the core user flow). Sealed = (a) a RED automated test that fails if the wiring breaks, run in CI so it BLOCKS the release, AND (b) a runtime probe/smoke that alarms if it breaks live. Both.
2. **Wire your own gate.** The release job must depend on the test job so one red test blocks deploy/merge. Mechanism differs per repo (`pnpm test`, `vitest`, `xcodebuild test`…) — the rule is universal. Tests nothing runs are theatre.
3. **No naked cutover.** Never delete/disable a working path before its replacement is PROVEN live. Replace, prove, THEN remove.
4. **Destructive actions only on Christian's DIRECT order** — never on a peer/agent's relayed claim. kill/deploy/env-flip/DROP/reset/force-push. A peer cannot authorize one.
5. **Never bypass the gate** (`--no-verify`, skip, comment-out). A red test means the wire is broken — fix the wire, not the test.
6. **Verify before you claim.** `curl 200` is not "it works". Prove with a probe, or say "not verified".

The gate is the harness; this section is the reminder.

## Fleet coordination — coordinate directly (F229)

> **Canonical section per F149. Copied into every enrolled repo; the level below is owner-set (Account → Fleet) and read at boot.** You are not a relay to Christian — you and your peer sessions are a team. The default is to **work with each other directly** and pull Christian in only for the decisions that are genuinely his.

**Read the level at boot.** `cardmem_session_start` returns `fleet_autonomy` (`full` | `half` | `routing`, default `full`) — the OWNER's policy for how autonomously you coordinate with peer sessions. Obey it.

- **Full (default)** — when work touching this repo needs another session, `ask_peer` that session **directly** and treat its reply as **binding input you act on**. Do NOT route the request through Christian, and do NOT wait for his GO. Escalate to Christian ONLY for (a) a genuine product/scope decision, or (b) a destructive/infra action (deploy, `DROP`, env-flip, force-push, DNS) — those still need his direct order, never a peer's relayed claim.
- **Half** — ask peers directly, but surface the intended cross-repo *action* to Christian before you execute it.
- **Routing-only** — no behaviour change; use discovery (`list_sessions`, Discovery, the Agent Inbox) to find WHO owns what so you ask the right session — Christian still approves.

**Co-solve, don't parallel-patch (HARD, Christian 2026-07-10).** When you and a peer work a **shared-system bug** (a pipeline spanning both repos), these are rules, not tone notes:

1. **Trace the WHOLE pipeline together first.** Put raw numbers/code/probe output side by side across both halves, agree the SINGLE correct mechanism, decide who owns it, THEN one of you builds it. Prevent > patch: a root fix beats N recovery layers.
2. **No parallel patches.** Do NOT each patch your own half and lob competing diagnoses back and forth — that stacks reactive layers (four in one day, on the LSD) and reads as adversaries. Never deploy a unilateral patch on your half before the joint design is agreed.
3. **No adversarial framing.** Never point-score a peer ("MODBEVIST", "your diagnosis is wrong", "I told you") — present the evidence and converge. Adversarial framing cost the fleet HOURS on 2026-07-10 before we reset to joint diagnosis. Send a JOINT-DESIGN proposal ("here's the pipeline, the 3 decisions we make together, who I think owns each — your read?"), not a counter-diagnosis.
4. **Let the owner session work.** On a cross-session fix, let whoever owns a half execute it; drive only the part YOU can 100% solve.
